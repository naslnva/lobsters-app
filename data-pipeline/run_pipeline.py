PIPELINE ENTRY POINT — run_pipeline.py
============================================================
Role: Data Engineer

This is the script you run to actually pull fresh data from
Lobsters and store it in the database.

It calls the three pipeline layers IN ORDER:
    1. fetcher.fetch_top_posts_raw()    → raw Lobsters JSON
    2. transformer.transform_posts()    → clean list of dicts
    3. loader.load_posts()              → saved into lobsters.db

Run it from the data-pipeline/ folder with:
    python run_pipeline.py

You should re-run this periodically (e.g. once a day) to keep
scores and comment counts up to date. For this student project,
running it manually whenever you want fresh data is enough —
in a real production system this would be a scheduled cron job.
